        // This means we need a button that starts the sequence of the game, by clicking start
        // Better create players, no need for start button
    // Sidebar with buttons: create player

    // 2. Let players place ships: 

    // Features that need DOM representation
    // 1. Gameboard: for each player: render gameboard each time from the gameboard

    
    // 2. Create players
